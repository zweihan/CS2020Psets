love is
A Poem For My Secret Love

I want to share my feelings
And I don't know how to start
But every single word I say
Is coming from my heart

The first time that I met you
All you said was "Hey"
It was really just a simple word
But it took my breath away

You were very fun to talk with
You were extremely sweet and kind
I was in love with every thing you said
You were amazing in my mind

You fill my days with brightness
You lift me up when I feel blue
You make me feel like I'm someone special
So I'd do anything for you

For you, I'd walk across the desert
So hot, without a breeze
For you, I'd dive into the ocean
And be swallowed by the seas

I barely even know you,
So this may be a surprise
There's nothing that you could do wrong
Because you're flawless in my eyes

I always wonder where you are
And I wish I could be there
You're probably so far away
But I can feel you everywhere.

You're the constant beating in my heart
You're the blood rushing through my veins
You're the light glowing from a moonbeam
You're the crystal droplets in the rain

You're the colors in the sunset
You're the rustling of the leaves
You're the twinkling in the nighttime stars
You're the very air I breathe

I care for you each hour
I dream of you all week
You're the last person running through my mind
Before I drift to sleep

I'm so grateful that you're in my life
Maybe someday we'll be together
I love you, and only you
I always will forever
A Place For You

If I could take you to one place, Elizabeth,
to one very special place,
I would take you to my heart.

You would sweep through it, like fresh rain.
Swirling across my landscape.
Drenching on my soul.
Blossoming hope, in my wounded places.

And, in return, I would fashion a world there, for you.
A space where you could sit, quietly.
A place where you could laugh, uncontrollably.
A moment when you could love, unreservedly.

In my heart, you would rest.
Wrapped in my spirit.
Warmed by my heat.
Riding at the very center of me.

I have learned much of love.
And much that I have learned is hard.
But I have not let it harden my heart.
There is a place there, for you.

There is a place of peace
There is a place of joy
A place away from loneliness
A place away from pain
That place is next to you
A secret garden
Where black and white becomes a colorful place
Of loving, kisses, touching, caressing,
There with you and only you
Cares of the world melting away
Anger and fear are not allowed
Prejudice cannot enter
A place where two hearts beat as one
A place where two souls are interwoven,
Touching the inner-place of one another
A place that I long to come back to again and again
A place of sweet abandon
A place next to you

Just wish I could find the words
That would make the meaning clear
About why I just love you so
And why I want you here

Why I need you here with me
So I can shower you with love
Why it is so clear to see
You are an angel from above

An angel sent from heavens high
To bring the lords own prayer
That you and I on blue skies fly
Share a love that is true and rare

A love that is so truly pure
That it completely fills my heart
A love that will forever endure
And that we shall never part

A love that will last you see
Until the end of time
A love which joins us - you and me
And forever will our hearts entwine

When times are hard, when news is bad,
When life seems a universe from brightness and joy,
When this happens, my love, I need you to know,
There is a person close who feels every tear,
A person close who holds you dear.

When you cry, he cries too, not always to see,
But always and with the full depth of his beating heart.
When you do not cry but the pain shows in your eyes,
He will know and share this too,
His passion hidden under a stoic umbrella,
A shield of calm prevents emotion displayed.

He knows of your journey through the turbulence of life,
He respects and admires the tireless fight,
He hates a world that could cause you pain,
Such innocence undeserving, he longs for your return to the sun,
A summer's mind where fears dissipate like seeds in wind,
To see what he loves; your smile to infinity,
Your passion for life... with vigour, with humour, with cheer.

So look over your shoulder and he'll be there,
No matter the distance, the time, he'll be there,
Watching you in sleep, aloof in morning haze,
As distance grows through day, the care for you remains.
He is your husband, your friend, your protector, your knight,
He is me my darling, he is me.
We are here my love together again
Back where we should have always been
Back where we were meant to be
Together as one just you and me

While we were apart it seemed so wrong
I longed for you my whole life long
I ached to be with you so very much
To hear your voice to feel your touch

And now at last we've met once more
In love again as we were before
More in love than we could have ever supposed
Together again life's circle closed.

Like the warmth of the morning sun,
So do thoughts of you embrace me,
Revealing how alive I am

A glorious light of the new day,
so is your presence in my life,
relieving it of its shadows,
and marking the start of a new beginning

Loving you has no end and no beginning
Loving you is everything
It is infinite in time
And limitless in magnitude
Beyond even my own comprehension

Your love brings me home
Enfolds me and warms me
In its eternal embrace
Endless and palpable
Beyond all life's storms

A connection like no other
Twenty years long
But timeless in our hearts
Deep and true
Til' death us do part
People speak of fate
and meetings of chance.
Finding of soul mates
and love at first glance.

Alignment of planets
Shooting stars up above.
Fullness of the moon
and pairs of white doves.

I've never taken stock
in these symbols and signs.
But having met you
proved I'd been blind.

Poets write of hearts
eternal devotion.
Flames of desire
and new found emotion.

Love ever lasting
a lifetime of bliss.
Heaven here on Earth
the passion of a kiss.

I've never found valid
these words foolishly penned.
Then you graced my presence
and proved me wrong again.

Singers sing of heartache
and the one that got away.
Internal emptiness
pain that still remains.

Missed opportunities
the hollowness of night.
Paths that never cross
timing that wasn't right.

I never dreamed those songs
could ever ring so true.
Until I thought of life
without ever knowing you.
I thought that I'd seen beauty
I thought I'd witnessed grace,
I thought that I'd known love
'Til I gazed upon your face.

I thought I'd felt my heart beat
I thought my knees were weak,
I thought I'd heard a songbird
Until I heard you speak.

I thought the rose was fragrant
I thought the sky was blue,
I thought nature wonderful
'Til I first laid eyes on you.

I thought the sun was shining
I thought I'd seen it all,
I thought that I was standing
Until you made me fall.

I thought my eyes were open
Yet now I'm not so sure,
I think that I may be in love
Like I've never loved before.

I'll hold on to these feelings
And keep them safe within,
Until the time they're needed
And true love can begin
A beautiful lady with eyes on fire,
That sparkle and laugh, that can smile and cry,
I love your eyes so clear and true.
Beautiful lady I adore you.

A twinkling look that bubbles bright,
With a heart to care, and a heart to love,
With hands to hold, and hands to help,
Beautiful lady there to give.

Beautiful lady, a smile so bright
So warm and gentle, so soft A delight
A voice so clear
That calms and soothes, a voice that wipes all fears

Beautiful lady
I'll give to you, my thoughts, my prayers, my hopes
I offer you my heart, my strength
My love is yours for ever

Beautiful lady
I love you as you are
Beautiful.

You are the sea that lulls me to sleep.
You are the treasure every pirate wants to keep.
You are the sun that gives life to my day.
You are the moon that lights the dark way.
You are the kiss that sets me free.
You are the embrace that comforts me.
You are the yin and yang of my life.
So I ask you now, please be my wife.

Beautiful lady, lily of the field
You, my umbrella and my shield
Your adoration showers like the rains
And drowns all odds and pains.

Searching everywhere unto the crest
Clear you stood above the rest
For never in my dreams most sweet
Did I such a lovely damsel meet.

Mesmerised I am, dreaming all the while
Of when we shall walk down the aisle
To vows we take we shall keep
With our affection ever deep.

For eternity our love shall sprout
Though the world be in drought
A union most blissful, this I know
For we ever shall sparkle and glow.
We have climbed the tall blue mountain,
to touch the eagle's wing,
Trekked the valley far below them,
to drink from crystal springs,

We have walked among the tall grasses,
through wildflowers we were lead,
They stood like noble kings and queens,
with crowns upon their heads,

The goldfinch and her family,
they kiss like you and I,
In the morning and come the evening,
they sing sweet lullabies,

I look back across the seasons,
thankful you were there,
To have wrapped my arms around you,
put ribbons in your hair,

If tomorrow holds my promise,
it will be to forever gaze into your eyes,
And dance with you forever,
in a land with no good-byes.
Your magnificent eyes, dark emeralds aflame
Your silky bronzed hair, still perfect in rain
The way you walk, a light antelope in prance
So cheerful and happy, ever ready to dance
Your lithe Brazilian figure, I marvel through the days
How beautiful you do become, in the wondrous sunshine rays
On those rare moments, when your eyes meet mine
I feel a warm pleasure and a chill down my spine
When I hear your sweet laughter, a melodious tune
I feel alive, full of joy; I could fly to the moon
I sit idly nigh always wishing you'd see
Perhaps even come and sit down next to me
I watch how you smile, and send jolts through my heart
Your sensual features a fine work of art
Sometimes I watch the evening's amber sun
And I calm myself down, from thoughts weighing a tonne
The soothing orange invigorates my mind
As do you, always so kind

When I look back
On the dreams I left behind;
Buried there in all my thoughts
It is you I always find.

I saw you then as I see you now
Through love's impassioned blindness,
A heart so fashioned there within
Filled with love and kindness.

How often has my heart declared
With anguish, for my words are few,
That the wind shall blow a little longer,
To keep me here with you.

Sweeter still are the pains of love.
The bonds of love grow stronger,
Even after the moonlight has gone to sleep,
I shall always love you longer.

No other can stir my heart so deep,
Or thrill me through and through,
And in my dreams there will never be
No other love but you.

When I look back to times gone by
There is one sure thing I know
It is you my love, who stole my heart
Fifty years ago.

Mystery, it clouds your form
Ecstasy, it keeps us warm
The dance has begun, with but us two
I'll take your hand, I'll walk with you
Take me to depths in the sea of love
Go with me further, never enough
I'll breathe in your perfumed scent
You intoxicate, invade my head

Give in to your senses, here we go
Follow me now, let your heart take control
Our time is short, and death is nigh
To mountains and peaks, we must fly
Leave life behind in our own world
Get away from it all, run with me, my pearl
Forget all your troubles, walk in the moonlight
Gaze into my eyes, stay with me tonight

We need not fear, we must venture on
Forsake loneliness, drink in our love's song
Pure angel of dawn, you've stolen my heart
You illuminate me, pierce the dark
Your purity, it leaves me numb
Your beauty, where does it come from?
I long to touch your smooth, soft skin
To stroke your hair, give you everything

To pull you into my embrace
To hear you breathe, to see your face
To feel your heart beat softly with mine
To hold you tightly, leave reason behind
To draw you in, to taste your kiss
All heartbreak gone, nothing amiss
I'd lose myself inside your eyes
Stay in love forever, mesmerized

Run away with me, barefoot in the sand
Walk by my side, rule all the lands
Hear our hearts beating with love so wild
Our heads spinning with passion, my child
There's untamed joy we can't contain
Hypnotizing ardor we can't explain
I'm Romeo, will you be Juliet?
We can share a bond we'll never forget

We can clasp hands in the twilight
Hold each other, day and night
We can be alone, just me and you
Our souls entwined, you know it's true
We can do anything, if you'll take faith
I'll protect you, I'll keep you safe
We can be together eternally
We can live forever – so come with me
